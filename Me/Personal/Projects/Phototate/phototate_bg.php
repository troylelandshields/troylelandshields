				Phototate is a super simple Python script I created to make rotating photos
				in batch much easier. I found that when I uploaded photos to 
				<a href="http://shldz.us/" target="_blank">shldz.us</a> some of them were rotated
				in odd ways, and needed to be fixed individually. I created this tool so that I could
				rotate them to the correct orientation in batch, which saved me a lot of time and headaches.
				I wrote it in Python because I'd never done any Python development and wanted to learn. <br><br>
