				<a target="_blank" href="http://shldz.us">shldz.us</a> started as a nice way to
				combine my two biggest passions: hanging out with my wife and computer programming.
				It's a website for our tiny-for-now family complete with a <a target="_blank" href="http://shldz.us/blog">blog</a>
				and <a target="_blank" href="http://shldz.us/travels">photo travelogue</a>.

				She and I work on this together and have fun in the process. We
				look forward to maintaining this site for many years to come so that we will
				have it as a record of our lives together.
