				Groupthink</a> started out as an Android project I worked on in-between 
				homework assignments during Winter semester of 2013. After attending a Microsoft
				event at BYU, however, I started working on the Windows 8 version of Groupthink
				and have yet to go back and finish the Android app. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Groupthink is supposed to be sort of an "idea marketplace" where people 
				with great ideas but lacking skills can connect with people that have
				stellar skills and bland ideas. The Windows 8 app, available for free, is 
				a good start to that end-goal, but I doubt I'll ever go back and work on 
				Groupthink any further than its current state.
